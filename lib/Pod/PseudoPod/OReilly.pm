=head1 NAME

Pod::PseudoPod::DocBook::OReilly - Turn Pod into O'Reilly's DocBook

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Pod::PseudoPod::DocBook::OReilly;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

***THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. MAJOR PARTS WILL CHANGE***

I wrote just enough of this module to get my job done, and I skipped every
part of the specification I didn't need while still making it flexible enough
to handle stuff later.

=head2 The style information

I don't handle all of the complexities of styles, defining styles, and
all that other stuff. There are methods to return style names, and you
can override those in a subclass.

If, for some reason, I disappear from the world, one of the other
members of the project can shepherd this module appropriately.
